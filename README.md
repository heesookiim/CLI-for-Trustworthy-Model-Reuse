Develop a CLI tool that extracts model information from GitHub repositories
Score the trustworthiness of models using specific metrics
Ensure the implemented code is simple, concise, and well-documented for handover to the customer's software engineering team

Packages are rated based on the following metrics  
  
- `Ramp-Up Time`: Evaluates how quickly a project can be set up and running
- `Correctness`: Measures how reliable the model is
- `Bus Factor`: Assesses the risk in project maintenance if key contributors leave
- `Responsive Maintenance`: Indicates the level of ongoing maintenance the project receives
- `License Compatibility`: Checks the project's compatibility with licenses
- `Net score`: (0.4 ∙ BusFactor)  + (0.15 ∙ Correctness) + (0.15 ∙ RampUp) + (0.3 ∙ ResponsiveMaintainer)-(1∙(1-License))
